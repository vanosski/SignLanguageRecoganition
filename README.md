# Sign Language Recognition

## Overview

The Sign Language Recognition project is designed to develop an intelligent system capable of recognizing and interpreting American Sign Language (ASL) gestures through image classification. The primary goal is to create an accessible tool that can bridge communication gaps for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, this project aims to deliver accurate and real-time sign language recognition.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Accurately classifies images of ASL gestures into corresponding labels.
- **Real-time Recognition**: Capable of recognizing signs from live video feeds.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to be intuitive for both developers and end-users.
- **Comprehensive Dataset**: Trained on a diverse dataset of ASL gestures to improve model robustness.

## Algorithms Used

1. **Quad Convo BatchNet**: 
   - A custom-built convolutional neural network model designed to optimize performance specifically for sign language recognition. It incorporates advanced techniques to enhance feature extraction and improve classification accuracy.

2. **Double CNN**: 
   - An architecture that utilizes two convolutional layers in succession, allowing the model to capture complex features from images more effectively. This approach enhances the ability to discern subtle differences in gestures.

3. **Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN)**: 
   - A traditional neural network structure that serves as a baseline for performance comparisons. It demonstrates the fundamental concepts of neural networks, providing insights into how more complex architectures improve upon basic classification tasks.

4. **VGG16**: 
   - A widely-used pre-trained model that employs transfer learning. VGG16 is known for its deep architecture, consisting of 16 layers, which helps in extracting rich feature representations from images. It has been fine-tuned for this specific task, resulting in enhanced recognition capabilities.

5. **YOLOv8**: 
   - An advanced real-time object detection algorithm that can detect and classify multiple objects within an image. In this project, YOLOv8 is integrated for gesture localization and recognition, allowing the system to identify and interpret signs in dynamic environments.

## Dataset

The model is trained on the ASL Alphabet dataset, which includes thousands of images representing various ASL signs. Each image is labeled according to the corresponding gesture, enabling supervised learning.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure the dataset is organized properly in the specified directory structure.
2. **Model Training**: Run the appropriate Jupyter Notebook to train the desired model architecture. Each notebook includes the necessary code to load data, preprocess images, and train the model.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model using test data to assess its accuracy and performance metrics.
4. **Real-Time Recognition**: Utilize the model for real-time gesture recognition by integrating it with a webcam or video feed.
